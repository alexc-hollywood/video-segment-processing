Install Celery and its dependencies:

```
pip install celery[redis]
```

Start Celery worker(s) on each computer you want to use for parallel processing:

```
celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

To increase the speed of this video processing system, we can try the following approaches:

Add more worker nodes: By increasing the number of worker nodes, we can process more video segments in parallel. Make sure to distribute the workers across multiple computers to take advantage of their processing power.

Use GPU acceleration: If the worker nodes have GPUs, we can use GPU-accelerated video codecs to speed up the transcoding process. For instance, we can use NVIDIA's NVENC for H.265/HEVC encoding. To use NVENC, replace the -c:v libx265 flag with -c:v hevc_nvenc in the transcode_segment function in tasks.py. Make sure you have the appropriate hardware and drivers installed.

Optimize FFmpeg settings: We can experiment with different FFmpeg settings, like adjusting the quality, preset, or bitrate, to balance processing speed and output quality. For example, we can use a faster preset for the x265 encoder by adding -preset fast to the FFmpeg command in the transcode_segment function. Keep in mind that faster presets may result in larger output files or lower video quality.

Load balancing: Ensure that the tasks are evenly distributed among the available worker nodes to maximize the utilization of resources. Celery can automatically load balance tasks across the workers, but you may need to fine-tune the configuration if you see bottlenecks or uneven distribution.

Use a more efficient parallel computing framework: Although Celery is a good choice for many parallel computing tasks, we might find other frameworks like Dask or Apache Spark better suited to your specific use case. These frameworks can provide additional features and optimizations for parallel processing.
